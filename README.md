## About The Project
Using the movies database I had the idea to create a sort of oscars esk voting website and I ended up with it being Disney animated princess movies focused and more ratings then votes. It uses dynamodb for the users and sql for the movies database. I spent a lot of time on it and learned a lot about html and dynamodb and how to work between all different platforms. I'd never worked with a map before and found that interesting seeing how dynamodb was similar and yet different from python. 

## Requirements
Please refer to the requirements.txt file in the project and install everything from that onto your computer. This should be everything you need in terms of libraries in order to run the project. 

## Running the Code
You'll need to make your own creds.py on your own machine. If using your own RDS, this is where you will put that and you will likely need to edit some naming conventions if you have used different ones than me for say your dynamodb database. Please look over the code carefully before starting and make sure you have everything setup!
